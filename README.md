# OMake 0.9

This is a maintenance version of OMake 0.9, based on 0.9.8.6-0.rc1.

## Why not 0.10.x ?

There are several issues introduced in 0.10.x. 
For example `omake -P` is no longer working in Mac OS X.
Unfortunately these issues seem not to be fixed in near future.

The source code difference between 0.9.8.6 and 0.10.x is too huge 
to find out which modifications cause these issues,
and the benefit of 0.10.x is not very clear to me:
all my OMake projects work fine with 0.9.8.6-0.rc1.
At least 0.9.8.6-0.rc1 is known to be fairly solid.
